#SCENARIO :
In the bustling stock exchange scenario, traders like Sarah interact with a command-based trading system.
Sarah submits specific commands to buy or sell stocks, and the trading system encapsulates these requests as objects.
These command objects allow traders to parameterize and queue stock-related actions,
enabling them to be executed at different times or by different entities within the system.
